# Profit_Prediction

A company should always set a goal that should be achievable, otherwise, employees will not be able to work to their best potential if they find that the goal set by the company is unachievable. The task of profit prediction for a particular period is the same as setting goals. If you know how much profit you can make with the amount of R&D and marketing you do, then a business can make more than the predicted profit provided the predicted value is achievable. So in this article, I will take you through the task of profit prediction with machine learning using Python.

## Profit Prediction with Machine Learning

The profit earned by a company for a particular period depends on several factors like how much time and money a company spends on R&D, marketing and many more. So for predicting the profit of a company for a particular period we need to train a machine learning model with a dataset that contains historical data about the profit generated by the company.

The task of predicting profit is an important task for every business to set an achievable goal. For example, if the business spends $500 on marketing, it canâ€™t expect a profit of $20,000. Likewise, there are many other factors on which the profit of a business depends. A company must therefore set a goal that can be achieved. In the section below, I will walk you through the task of profit prediction with machine learning using Python.

The dataset that I am using for the task of profit prediction includes data about the R&D spend, Administration cost, Marketing Spend, State of operation, and the historical profit generated by 50 startups .
